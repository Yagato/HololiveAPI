API developed for didactic purposes using Spring Boot. It contains information about all hololive and HOLOSTARS talents, their illustrators/riggers and generations.

<br>

Most of the data and resources available in this API were taken directly from the [hololive Fan Wiki](https://hololive.wiki/wiki/Main_Page), so big shoutouts to them!

<br>

The documentation is available right [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26593368/2s93XzwMzz).
